So our service is going to do and require the following:

-Input user section and role to establish basis for privilege

-Cross reference the account of the user to see what they can and cannot do

-Based on their privilege, the user can be given the option to do
additional things to the article besides reading it; otherwise they will only be able to read

-We will use Python 

-Keep track of changes 

-Our service will request an article's unique ID from the gateway API; this will allow us to associate the content with the correct article title. Provided this information we will be able to assign correct permissions for each respective user depending upon the article.
