# PipeDream_ContentCreationFeature
So our service is going to do and require the following:

-Input user section and role to establish basis for privilege
-Cross reference the account of the user to see what they can and cannot do
-Based on their privilege, the user can be given the option to do
additional things to the article besides reading it; otherwise they will only be able to read
-We will use NodeJS
